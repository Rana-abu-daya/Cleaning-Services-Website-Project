Homey: Revolutionizing Home Cleaning Services
Welcome to Homey, a comprehensive booking system designed specifically for cleaning services. Our platform is user-friendly and caters to the unique needs of administrators, cleaners, and customers.
Homey is a Spring Boot web application, leveraging the power and versatility of Java and Spring Boot to ensure a robust and scalable system. It adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, promoting clean and maintainable code. Data access is handled by JPA repositories, which abstract the data layer, allowing for seamless database operations without writing SQL queries. User authentication and role management are also key aspects of the system, ensuring a secure environment where users can only access appropriate features and data.
Default Services
There are three default cleaning services:
1.	Window Cleaning: Our professionals provide thorough window cleaning services, ensuring a clear view and a bright home.
2.	Regular Cleaning: This service covers the basic cleaning needs of any home, maintaining a clean and comfortable living environment.
3.	Deep Cleaning: For those times when you need a bit more than the regular cleaning, our deep cleaning service ensures every nook and cranny is spotless.
Default Admin
For testing and initial setup, we have a default admin account:
•	Email: test@gmail.com
•	Password: 1234

We hope you enjoy using Homey and find it useful. If you have any questions, issues, or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or send us a message.
